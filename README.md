## DSA Notes and Practice in JavaScript

Welcome to my personal repository for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice using JavaScript.

### ðŸ“Œ About This Repo

This repo is a genuine learning log. I'm using it to:

- Practice DSA problems
- Record notes on different approaches
- Store time and space complexity analysis
- Track progress and reflect on my learning

### ðŸ›  Structure

Each folder or file typically contains:

- Problem statement (in comments)
- One or more solutions (brute-force to optimized)
- Explanations and edge case handling
- Complexity analysis

### ðŸ“ˆ Why This Exists

I'm learning DSA to build strong problem-solving skills and improve as a developer. This repo serves as both my journal and my reference.

### ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- VS Code
- GitHub for version control and storage

Feel free to explore and suggest improvements. Iâ€™m always open to learning better ways to write and optimize code.
